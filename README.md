# UFOs

### Overview
We were tasked with implementing a filtering algorithm for UFO sighting data. We used Javascript to accomplish this for our friend Dana.

### Results
Upon opening the UFO sighting page, a table containing all UFO sigtings in our dataset appears. In order to sort through this data click on the fields to the left of the table and enter the desired data values. After pressing enter or clicking outside of the box, the table updates automatically. An example using the state of Texas is seen above 

### Summary
We accomplished Dana's goal by filtering UFO sighting data. That being said, there was a lack of data, as well as a lack of data fields. To fix the quantity of data, I would add several more datasets of UFO sightings. In doing so, there would be many more potential fields by which we could further filter our data.
